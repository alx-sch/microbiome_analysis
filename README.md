- Excursion FASTA Files:
  - FASTA (.fna) files have the following structure:
    - Lines starting with '>' indicate the beginning of a sequence record (incl unqiue identifier).
    - The actual sequence data follows this indicator line (can be multiple lines)
    ```bash
    >NC_004917.1 Helicobacter hepaticus ATCC 51449, complete sequence
    CATTAAACCAAGTATAAAATCTATAAATTATCTTTA...
    ```


- Indexing:
  - BWA indexing is the process of creating an efficient data structure from a reference genome, allowing the BWA algorithm to rapidly align short DNA sequences during high-throughput sequencing analysis.
   - `bwa index -p pathogen_combined_index combined_pathogen_genomes.fna`
   - `bwa index -p mouse_index GCF_000001635.27_GRCm39_genomic.fna` (~18 hours!)

## Experimental Data

Download DNA sequencing data from experiments, onbtained from feces; ideally containing full genomes (microbial and host components):
  - https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SRX3198644:  `fasterq-dump --outdir . --gzip SRX3198644`
    - Only 74.9 kB --> 220 reads (`wc -l SRX3198644.fastq | awk '{print $1/4}`)

  - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX22381836[accn]: `fastq-dump --outdir . --gzip --split-files SRR26681942`
    - Both files 10.0 GB each (!)  --> two files as data was generated by pair-end sequencing
    - -> 22.4M reads each set --> heavy on computation --> create subsets for a general overview

  - Excursion: FASTQ Files:
    - Contains sequence data and quality information, as produced by sequencing machines
    - Each entry conists of four lines:
        - Sequence Indentifier Line: Starts with **'@'** followed by unique identifier for the read, may contain additional information like sequencing instrumet, sample details, read length, etc.
        - Sequence Line: Containts actual nucleotide sequence of DNA/RNA read.
        - Quality Score Identifier Line: Start with **'+'** and usually mirrors the sequence identifier line.
        - Quality Score Line: Contains ASCII-encoded quality scores, representing the confidence/accuracy of each base call.
      ```bash
      @SRX3198644.1 1 length=45
      TTGTTGAACTGGCTCTTTTTCGCAATCCCGCTGTAAGTACTGTCT
      +SRX3198644.1 1 length=45
      AAAAAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAEEAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
      ```

  -  Generating subsets of ~1M reads each using 'seqtk':
      - `seqtk sample -s 42 SRR26681942_1.fastq 0.05 > subset_SRR26681942_1.fastq`
      - `seqtk sample -s 42 SRR26681942_2.fastq 0.05 > subset_SRR26681942_2.fastq`
      - '42' is a seed value (making random sampling reproducale), new subsets contain 5% of total reads.

  

pipeline:
1. align reads from exp (feces) to mouse genome
2. filter unmapped reads
3. align those reads to pathogens

```bash

mouse_index="../1_index/mouse_index"
pathogen_index="../1_index/pathogen_combined_index"
input_reads="../2_exp_fastq/SRX3198644.fastq"

# Step 1: Align against the mouse genome
bwa mem -t 4 "$mouse_index" "$input_reads" > aligned_to_mouse.sam

# Step 2: Filter unmapped reads and convert to BAM
samtools view -b -f 4 aligned_to_mouse.sam > unmapped_to_mouse.bam

# Step 3: Align unmapped reads against the pathogens
bwa mem -t 4 "$pathogen_index" unmapped_to_mouse.bam | samtools view -b - > aligned_to_pathogen.bam

# Step 4: Generate index for the aligned_to_pathogen.bam file
samtools index aligned_to_pathogen.bam

# Step 5: Generate index statistics for the final BAM file
samtools idxstats aligned_to_pathogen.bam > aligned_to_pathogen_idxstats.txt
```

#### BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner):
Purpose:
- BWA is a software package used for aligning short DNA sequences against a large reference genome.
- It employs the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) algorithm to efficiently align short reads to a reference sequence.

Usage in the Script:
- In the script, BWA is used to align the experimental short DNA sequences (reads) against two different reference genomes: the mouse genome and a combined index for various pathogens.
- The `bwa mem` command is specifically used for DNA sequence alignment using the mem algorithm, suitable for short reads.
  
#### Samtools:
Purpose:
- Samtools is a suite of programs for interacting with high-throughput sequencing data in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) and BAM (Binary Alignment/Map) formats.
- It provides various utilities for manipulating, viewing, and analyzing sequence alignment data.
- 
Usage in the Script:
- In the script, Samtools is primarily used for two tasks:
  1. Filtering Unmapped Reads:
    - samtools view is used to filter reads based on specific criteria, such as selecting only unmapped reads ( `-f 4 ` flag).
    - The filtered reads are then redirected to a new BAM file (unmapped_to_mouse.bam).
      
#### Overall Workflow:
1. Alignment to Mouse Genome:
    - BWA is used to align short DNA reads from the experiment to the mouse genome, producing a SAM file (aligned_to_mouse.sam).

2. Filtering Unmapped Reads:
    - Samtools is employed to filter out unmapped reads from the SAM file, resulting in a new BAM file (unmapped_to_mouse.bam).

3. Conversion to BAM Format:
    - Samtools is used to explicitly convert the BAM file containing unmapped reads to BAM format.

4. Alignment to Pathogens:
   - BWA is used again to align the unmapped reads (now in BAM format) to a combined index for various pathogens, generating a BAM file (aligned_to_pathogen.bam).
